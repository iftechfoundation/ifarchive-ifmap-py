# A wrapper script which runs make-master-index followed by build-indexes,
# but in the background. This script can therefore be invoked by the
# admin server tool without blocking httpd.

# The -a argument removes build.lasttime, which means that the
# build-indexes script (when we get there) will regenerate all index
# pages instead of just the most recent changes. It's hacky to delete
# this outside the build.lock, but it would be more hacky to pass
# an argument all the way down to ifmap.py.
